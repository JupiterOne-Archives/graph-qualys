# Development

The Qualys integration uses various endpoints within the collection of Qualys
APIs to ingest data.

## Provider account setup

1. Request a [free trial of Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/free-trial/). You'll
   receive an email with your username and a link to access and reset your
   password.
2. Create a Web Application and a Vulnerabilty Scan of the application.
3. Find your API URL from the **Help** -> **About** link in the web app.

## Configure your .env

Here's the recommended `.env` for this project (filling in your credentials):

```ini
QUALYS_USERNAME=
QUALYS_PASSWORD=
QUALYS_API_URL=https://qualysapi.qg3.apps.qualys.com
```

## Execution

With the `.env` file in place, execute the integration:

```sh
yarn start
```

This project also provides a [mock Qualys server](#mock-qualys-server).

## GCP Cloud Agent

GCP Cloud Agent can be used to ingest detections from GCP Hosts. The
instructions on this page can be followed to connect Qualys with a GCP Project:
[Deploy Cloud Agent From GCP](https://success.qualys.com/discussions/s/article/000005839)

## Azure Virtual Scanner

Qualys Virtual Scanners can be used to ingest detections from Azure Virtual
Machines. The instructions on this page can be followed to connect Qualys
Virtual Scanner with Azure:
[Deploying Scanners in Azure Platform](https://www.qualys.com/docs/qualys-securing-azure-with-qualys.pdf)

## Mock Qualys Server

The mock Qualys server was created to facilitate performance and load testing.
It can be started on your development machine:

```sh
yarn start:qualys
```

Change your `.env` so the integration will connect to this service:

```ini
QUALYS_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Public Access

You may also run the integration on a public IP address on an Amazon Linux
computer in AWS, 2 vCPU + 8GB is necessary to support concurrent requests
(memory required to generate the response data).

1. Launch an instance
   - Default VPC
   - Public IP address
   - New security group to isolate
   - Add rule to allow inbound TCP on port 8080
2. Use EC2 Instance Connect in browser to gain terminal access
3. Perform the following to load and execute the code

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 12.20.0
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
. ~/.bash_profile
sudo yum install git
git clone https://github.com/JupiterOne/graph-qualys.git
cd graph-qualys
yarn install
LOG_REQUESTS=1 NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192' yarn start:qualys
```

Edit `graph-qualys/tools/qualys-server/start.ts` to configure the amount of data
generated.

Test access with the following:

```sh
curl -d 'ids=1,2,3' http://ec2-18-207-1-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/vm/detection/
```
