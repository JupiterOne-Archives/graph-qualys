- Ingest Azure data from Host Detection to support new relationships:

  | Source Entity                  | Relationship | Target Entity |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
  | `qualys_vulnerability_manager` | `SCANS`      | `azure_vm`    |
  | `qualys_host_finding`          | `HAS`        | `azure_vm`    |

## [5.13.0] - 2022-11-03

### Added

- Added `tags` property to `qualys_host_finding` entities.

## [5.12.0] - 2022-06-13

### Added

- Added `webAppScanApplicationIdFilter` config variable to only request/ingest
  web apps that match IDs provided in the filter

## [5.11.9] - 2022-06-01

### Fixed

- Updated the filter for web app scans and web app findings to use `GREATER`
  operator when querying using the last since date. Previously this was using
  `EQUAL` which caused no data to be ingested for those steps

## Added

- managed question

## [5.11.7] - 2022-05-23

### Fixed

  because it is more lightweight than `activity_log`, which caused errors for
  larger customers
- QPS endpoints will now check for `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` response and throw an
  appropriate error
- Removed deprecated `.compile()` call for regex

## [5.11.6] - 2022-05-12

### Fixed

- Pad AWS Account IDs with leading 0's if they are less than 12 characters,
  making them valid AWS Account IDs

## [5.11.5] - 2022-05-06

### Added

- `code-ql` workflow
- `questions` workflow
- managed questions

## [5.11.4] - 2022-04-20

### Changed

- Use sync `jobState.hasKey()` when doing concurrent ingestion to avoid
  duplicate key error

### Changed

- Increased the rate limit attempts to 20

## [5.11.2] - 2022-04-18

### Changed

- Increased the rate limit attempts from 5 to 10

## [5.11.1] - 2022-04-18

### Changed

- Logging the rate limit/concurrency error message from Qualys rather than the
  generic rate limit message

## [5.11.0] - 2022-03-09

### Added

- New properties added to resources:

  | Entity                   | Properties       |
  | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
  | `qualys_host_finding`    | `qualysSeverity` |
  | `qualys_web_app_finding` | `qualysSeverity` |

### Changed

- New properties added to resources:

  | Entity                | Properties                            |
  | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | `qualys_host_finding` | `gcpProjectId`, `gcpInstanceSelfLink` |

- Ingest GCP data from Host Detection to support new relationships:

  | Source Entity                  | Relationship | Target Entity             |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------- |
  | `qualys_vulnerability_manager` | `SCANS`      | `google_compute_instance` |
  | `qualys_host_finding`          | `HAS`        | `google_compute_instance` |

## [5.10.1] - 2022-03-03

### Changed

- `cveList` property changed to `cveIds` and a bug causing `CVEList` to
  serialize to `[Object object]` has been fixed using the new function
  `cveListToCveIds`

## [5.10.0] - 2022-02-28

### Changed

- New properties added to resources:

  | Entity                | Properties     |
  | --------------------- | -------------- |
  | `qualys_host_finding` | `awsAccountId` |

## [5.9.5] - 2022-02-16

### Changed

- Socket timeout will now throw the specific error and verifyAuthentication will
  allow timeouts to continue to execute.

## [5.9.4] - 2022-02-14

### Added

- Set 1 min timeout for validate Auth call which may be hanging in some
  instances
- Added log statements around execution of `verifyAuthentication` function

## [5.9.3] - 2021-12-17

### Changed

- Changed `qualysAssetId` to use `Asset ID` and added the `qualysQWebHostId`
  property to the `dicovered_host` that the `Service|Scanner` maps to. This will
  be used as the filter in the `persister` to work through the streamed
  mappings.

## [5.9.2] - 2021-12-06

### Added

- Added first 300 bytes of detection results as `Finding.details` when the
  detection represents a vulnerability in the set of `vmdrFindingResultQids`
  provided in the configuration. This is optional and it will come at a
  significant processing cost due to the number of additional bytes transferred
  for all host detections.

## [5.9.1] - 2021-12-01

### Changed

- Changed the `qualysAssetId` values to use `qWebHostId` once again to verify
  streamed mappings are working properly. Temporarily removing
  `qualysQWebHostId` until streamed mappings rule is updated to point to that
  property.

## [5.9.0] - 2021-11-30

### Changed

- `Finding -> discovered_host` mapping now uses actual `qualysAssetId` for
  target enitity rather than `qWebHostId` which caused mappings to not be
  created properly.

- Changed `qualysHostId` property name on `discovered_host` target entity to
  `qualysQWebHostId` to more accurately represent which value is being used.

### Fixed

- Fixed a failure to properly map `Service - SCANS -> Host` relationships. The
  mapping target entity value for `discovered_host.qualysAssetId` needs to match
  the `Finding.hostId` so that `Service - SCANS -> Host` and
  `Finding <- HAS - Host` relationships connect to the same `Host` entities. See
  `src/provider/client/types/index.ts` for details on the distinctions between
  Qualys host IDs.

## [5.8.9] - 2021-10-28

### Changed

- Web App Scan step is able to be enabled/disabled based on configuration. To
  support this change, the Vulnerability step now runs in separate dependency
  graph that runs after all other steps.

- Fixed discrepency in how `discovered_host._key` is generated to match the
  value produced by the `Finding <- HAS - discovered_host` relationship
  processing.

## [5.8.8] - 2021-10-19

### Changed

- Specified the status filter for host detections as
  `New,Fixed,Active,Re-Opened` to ensure `Fixed` detections are ingested because
  by default they are not returned.

## [5.8.7] - 2021-10-14

### Changed

- Update to `@jupiterone/integration-sdk-*@7.0.0`

### Added

- Added log for summary of host detections processed

## [5.8.6] - 2021-10-13

### Changed

- Changed host detection filters from `vm_scan_date_after` and
  `vm_scan_date_before` to `vm_processed_after` and `vm_processed_before`
  respectively. This is the recommended filter by Qualys for automated systems
  pulling this data. More info on this can be found
  [here](https://success.qualys.com/support/s/article/000005866)
- Commented out some tests temporarily

## [5.8.5] - 2021-10-11

### Changed

- Removed logging for EC2 Arns encountered used for temporary debugging

## [5.8.4] - 2021-10-05

### Added

- Logs added to debug missing `qualys_host_finding` to ec2 `Host` mappings

## [5.8.2] - 2021-09-15

### Changed

- `Service -> Host` mapped relationship will now map using `qualysAssetId`
  rather than `fqdn` for target filter.

### Added

- New properties added to resources:

  | Entity                | Properties |
  | --------------------- | ---------- |
  | `qualys_host_finding` | `hostId`   |

## [5.8.1] - 2021-07-27

### Changed

- Removed the creation of `_type: cve` entities and now only produce
  `qualys_vuln` entities. This was decided in order to standardize the
  `Vulnerability` entities created in this integration and avoid adding
  Qualys-specific properties to `cve` entities. Qualys vulnerabilities that
  reference CVE identifiers now have a `cveList` property on the `qualys_vuln`
  entity to support searching by CVE ID.

### Added

- New properties added to resources:

  | Entity        | Properties                                                                                   |
  | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `qualys_vuln` | `cveList`, `cvssScore`, `cvssScoreV3`, `vulnType`, `solution`, `discoveryRemote`, `category` |

## 5.7.3 - 2021-07-27

### Changed

- Removed mapping of `ThreatIntel.findingId === Finding.id`. Users should
  consider removing ThreatIntel findingId; it will not be used for mapping and
  may cause confusion.

- Assume `400` response with `Unrecognized parameter(s): username` when checking
  credentials does not mean credentials are invalid. This will allow the
  integration to continue ingestion even when `activity_log` endpoint isn't
  authorized for the current user.

- Fix `verifyAuthentication` to throw `IntegrationProviderAuthenticationError`
  when the account is expired instead of an `IntegrationValidationError` since
  the account information is correct, only the account is expired.

- Fix `verifyAuthentication` to throw `IntegrationProviderAPIError` on
  unexpected responses instead of `IntegrationValidationError` so that operators
  are notified.

## 5.7.2 - 2021-07-23

### Changed

- Throws `IntegrationProviderAuthorizationError` for case when status code `200`
  is returned but `responseCode` is `UNAUTHORIZED`. This error is displayed to
  user as it is a user configuration issue.

## 5.7.1 - 2021-07-04

### Fixed

- [#45](https://github.com/JupiterOne/integrations/issues/45) 400 Bad Request
  verifying authentication does not provide details from the response body

## 5.7.0 - 2021-06-17

### Added

- Configure host detection types with `Potential,Confirmed` in the
  `vmdrFindingTypes` instance config field (`VMDR_FINDING_TYPES` in `.env`).

### Changed

- Only host detections with types `Potential,Confirmed` are ingested by default.
  It is recommended to avoid ingesting `Info` detections until you're ready to
  process them in a meaningful way.

## 5.6.0 - 2021-05-22

### Changed

- Use host asset `dnsHostName` in `Finding.targets` and `Finding.fqdn` when
  available and fall back to host asset `fqdn`. The latter is often an empty
  string and not useful for intended purpose.

- Use host asset `hostname` as `Host.hostname` when available.

## 5.5.0 - 2021-04-30

### Added

- Configure host detection severities with `2,3,4` in the
  `vmdrFindingSeverities` instance config field (`VMDR_FINDING_SEVERITIES` in
  `.env`).

### Changed

- Only host detections with severities `3,4,5` are ingested by default. It is
  recommended to avoid ingesting lower severity detections until you're ready to
  process them in a meaningful way.

## 5.4.4 - 2021-04-23

### Fixed

- #101 Fixed another error handling host details with
  `host.fqdn.toLowerCase not a function`

## 5.4.3 - 2021-04-20

### Added

- Added `Finding.id` to equal `Finding._key` to allow for mapping by
  `ThreatIntel.findingId`. Users must identify the `Finding.id` value in
  JupiterOne and provide it when uploading `ThreatIntel`. Please note in the
  case where the `_key` changes, the `id` will also change! This may occur
  should the `_key` prove to be insufficiently unique.

### Fixed

- #101 Fixed error handling host details with
  `host.fqdn.toLowerCase not a function`

## 5.4.2 - 2021-04-20

### Fixed

- #101 Fixed error handling host details with `os.toLowerCase not a function`

## 5.4.1 - 2021-04-20

### Added

- Added support for host asset tags returned as `tags.TAG[]`.
- Added lots more tests for tags processing.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where EC2 tags would overwrite `host.tags` values when they had the
  same name.

- Fix bug where `Host.tags` could be an `object` and fail to validate uploads to
  J1. The code will set `Host.tags = 'INVALID'` when it cannot resolve the tags.
  Please let us know if you find this value in your `Host.tags`, we may need
  your help to see what Qualys APIs return for your data.

## 5.4.0 - 2021-04-19

### Changed

- Added additional properties to `discovered_host` `Host` mapped entities:

  - `tags`: Simple Qualys asset tag values (i.e. `tags: ["Cloud Agent"]`)

- Added additional properties to `aws_instance` `Host` mapped entities:

  - `tag.*`: Named tag properties from EC2 instance (i.e. `tag.Owner = "value"`)
  - `tags`: Simple Qualys asset tag values (i.e. `tags: ["Cloud Agent"]`)
  - `qualysFirstDiscoveredOn`
  - `qualysLastUpdatedOn`
  - `accountId`
  - `region`
  - `state`
  - `reservationId`
  - `availabilityZone`
  - `subnetId`
  - `vpcId`
  - `instanceId`
  - `instanceType`
  - `imageId`
  - `privateDnsName`
  - `publicDnsName`
  - `publicIpAddress`

- Added `Vulnerability.qid` to support mapping
  `TheatIntel.vulnId === Vulnerability.qid`. Note that `ThreatIntel.vulnId` must
  be of type `number` for the mapping to function.

  A Qualys detection may be associated with many CVEs. These detections become
  entities having
  `{ _class: 'Vulnerability', _type: 'cve', id: 'CVE-ID-HERE', qid: 123456 }`.
  When there are no CVEs associated with the detection, entities are produced as
  `{ _class: 'Vulnerability', _type: 'qualys_vuln', id: '123456', qid: 123456 }`.
  All `id` properties are intended to be String values; `qid` is a number to
  reflect the type of the value from the source, supporting queries such as
  `find Vulnerabilty with qid=123456`.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing `_key` on `aws_instance` `Host` mapped entities.

## 5.3.1 - 2021-03-31

### Changed

- The value of the Qualys `HostAsset.fqdn` is now normalized with
  `toLowerCase()`. The value is stored in `Finding.targets` and as `Host.fqdn`.
  This supports mapping rules that work by finding matching values.

## 5.3.0 - 2021-02-17

### Changed

- Host `Finding.targets` has been adjusted to include only
  `[detection.HOST.IP, assetHost.fqdn, assetHost.ec2InstanceArn]`. At this time,
  only `fqdn` and `ec2InstanceArn` will be used for mapping to the `Host`
  entity.

### Added

- Host `Finding` entities now has properties `fqdn`, `ec2InstanceArn`. These are
  used to map the `Finding` to the `Host` entities, which may be owned by other
  integrations (such as AWS).

## 5.2.1 - 2021-02-05

- Adjusted host details fetch settings:
  - Page size `2000` -> `250`
  - Request concurrency `10` -> `5`
  - Timeout `10` -> `5` minutes

## 5.2.0 - 2021-01-19

### Changed

- Adjusted host details fetch settings:
  - Page size `250` -> `2000`
  - Request concurrency `10` -> `5`
  - Timeout `5` -> `8` minutes

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in QID -> finding key tracking that kept the program from
  associating all findings to their vulnerabilities

## 5.1.0 - 2021-01-14

### Changed

- Fetching knowledge base vulnerabilities using concurrency headers from Qualys
  server responses
- Mock Qualys server enforces concurrency limits in vulnerabilities endpoint
- Mock Qualys server answers vulnerabilities that have CVEs and some that don't
- Enable ingestion of Finding - IS -> Vulnerability mapped relationships

## 5.0.4 - 2021-01-05

### Added

- Mock Qualys server prevents exceeding detections endpoint concurrency limit,
  answers `409` response when exceeded
- Mock Qualys server allows simulating additional number of concurrent requests
  that belong to other scripts, to assist testing concurrency code

### Changed

- Disable receiving the `RESULTS` field from the Qualys host detections response

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in concurrency calculation that allowed too many active requests

## 5.0.3 - 2021-01-04

### Fixed

- Detections request concurrency incorrectly calculated, reducing number of
  active requests

## 5.0.2 - 2021-01-03

### Changed

- Mock Qualys server data generator may be configured to emit exact numbers of
  hosts and total detections across all hosts
- XML data for detections sometimes contain `DETECTION.QID` values such as:

  ```js
  '{"#text":"o��t�","��\u001dX�Ď��,</QID":{"TYPE":"Info","FIRST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","LAST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","TIMES_FOUND":1,"IS_DISABLED":0,"LAST_PROCESSED_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:35Z"},"DETECTION":[{"QID":"��\u001b�\u001c�\u0002$�{\b����#","TYPE":"Info","FIRST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","LAST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","TIMES_FOUND":1,"IS_DISABLED":0,"LAST_PROCESSED_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:35Z"},{"QID":"�4P��H����\n�V�\u0019","TYPE":"Info","FIRST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","LAST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","TIMES_FOUND":1,"IS_DISABLED":0,"LAST_PROCESSED_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:35Z"},{"QID":"�����\u000e\u0010�R\u000bq�U!�","TYPE":"Info","FIRST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","LAST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","TIMES_FOUND":1,"IS_DISABLED":0,"LAST_PROCESSED_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:35Z"},{"QID":":u��GĹ�K_���\u001d�","TYPE":"Info","FIRST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","LAST_FOUND_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:04Z","TIMES_FOUND":1,"IS_DISABLED":0,"LAST_PROCESSED_DATETIME":"2020-12-30T03:44:35Z"}]}';

  ```

  When `typeof QID !== 'number'`, the detection will be skipped and the number
  of times this occurrs is logged.

- `iterateHostDetections` defaults to requesting detections for 2,500 hosts per
  page

## 4.1.2 2020-10-11

### Changed

- `iterateScannedHostIds` defaults to requesting 5000 IDs per page
- `iterateHostDetails` now supports `options?: { pageSize }` and defaults to
  requesting details for 1000 hosts per page
- `iterateHostDetections` now supports `options?: { pageSize }` and defaults to
  requesting detections for 1000 hosts per page
- `iterateVulnerabilities` now supports `options?: { pageSize }` and defaults to
  requesting 1000 vulnerabilities per page

## 4.1.1 2020-10-10

### Fixed

- Fixed pagination request URL to avoid prepending that produced
  `https://qualysapi.qualys.comhttps://qualysapi.qualys.com/api/2.0/fo/asset/host/`

## 4.1.0 2020-10-10

### Added

- `iterateScannedHostIds` to allow for paginating requests for scanned host IDs.

### Fixed

- `fetchScannedHostIds` when there is more than a single host in the list.

### Changed

- `STEP_FETCH_SCANNED_HOST_IDS` now uses `iterateScannedHostIds` and issues
  `logger.info` with an updated total count of seen IDs.

## 4.0.0 2020-10-09

This is a significant change to the program structure to be sure, but also makes
significant changes to the generated graph to move to the documented
vulnerability
[findings model](https://support.jupiterone.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041429733-Data-Model-for-Vulnerability-Management).

### Changed

- Break ingestion into multiple steps.
- Adopt pattern of `iterateResources` in provider client code.
- Ensure exceptions are handled and retries performed in all APIs.
- Use rate limit response headers from VMDR API to throttle client, avoiding
  unneccessary retries.
- Add basic handling of concurrency response headers by waiting for a bit before
  retrying.
- Create an `Account` entity.
- Create a `Service` entity for VMDR, WAS, relate them to `Account`.
- Add `function` to `Service` entities.
- Create a mapped relationship
  `Service - SCANS -> {_class: 'Host', _type: 'aws_instance', _key: '<instance arn>', id: [<instanceId>, <hostAssetId>, <qwebHostId>]`
  to relate to existing entities and allow for entity adoption when the AWS
  integration runs.
- Create a mapped relationship
  `Service - SCANS -> {_class: 'Host', _type: 'discovered_host', _key: 'qualys-host:<qwebHostId>', id: [<hostAssetId>, <qwebHostId>]`
  to cause the mapper to create the entity.
- Collect raw data on `Finding` entities.
- Create direct relationship `Service - IDENTIFIED -> Finding`.
- Rely on global mapping for `Finding <- HAS - Host`. This depends on
  `Finding.targets` including `Host.id` values (hostAssetId, qwebHostId).
- Create a mapped relationship
  `Finding - IS -> {_class: 'Vulnerability', _type: 'cve', _key: '<cve.id>'` for
  each CVE in the vulnerability. This will relate the `Finding` to the global
  `cve` entities that all scanner integrations reference.
- Create a mapped relationship `Service - SCANS -> WebApp`.
- Ingest wep app `Finding`, including values in `targets` to allow global
  mappings to function.
- Normalize `Finding.numericSeverity` to a range of 1-10 on web app and host
  `Finding` entities to match data model.
- Use `informational` instead of `info` for `Finding.severity`.
- Process unexpected severity values: <= 0 are `informational`, >= 5 are
  `critical`.
- Add `publicIpAddress`, `privateIpAddress` to `Host` entities.
